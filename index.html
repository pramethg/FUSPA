      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
        Understanding brain-wide hemodynamic responses to different stimuli at
        high spatiotemporal resolutions can help study <br />
        neuro-disorders and brain functions. However, the existing brain imaging
        technologies have limited resolution, sensitivity, <br />
        imaging depth and provide information about only one or two hemodynamic
        parameters. To address this, we propose a multimodal
        <br />
        functional ultrasound and photoacoustic (fUSPA) imaging platform, which
        integrates ultrafast ultrasound and multispectral <br />
        photoacoustic imaging methods in a compact head-mountable device, to
        quantitatively map cerebral blood volume (CBV), <br />
        cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen saturation (SO2) dynamics as well as
        contrast agent enhanced brain imaging with high <br />
        spatiotemporal resolutions. After systematic characterization, the fUSPA
        system was applied to quantitatively study the changes <br />
        in brain hemodynamics and vascular reactivity at single vessel
        resolution in response to hypercapnia stimulation. Our results <br />
        show an overall increase in brain-wide CBV, CBF, and SO2, but regional
        differences in singular cortical veins and arteries and a <br />
        reproducible anti-correlation pattern between venous and cortical
        hemodynamics, demonstrating the capabilities of the fUSPA system
        <br />
        for providing multiparametric cerebrovascular information at
        high-resolution and sensitivity, that can bring insights into the
        <br />
        complex mechanisms of neurodiseases.
